Sahibine Ulas Mobile App is designed for pet tracking system

## Getting Started

The system coded on the flutter. Firebase Firestore used for database process.
I didn't use the model for database. So we can send any data from app.
Please be careful about this situation.
All the images should store at images folder in project source.

## Project Run

Flutter package should be installed, I suggest visual studio code as coding platform.
After all the installation, Run the flutter pub get command on terminal. All the packages in the projects will install.
After this just run flutter run command on terminal in project folder.
